# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, and then pivot that dataframe from the months of January & April of 2019 to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. To do that I had to use my skills and knowledge of python, pandas, and matplotlib.
## Results:

- Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares while having the lowest average fare per ride and driver.
- Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares despite having the highest average fare per ride and driver.
- Suburban cities are second in all the stats.
- There are more divers than rides in urban cities compared to rural and suburban which has more rides than drivers.
## Summary:
Three recommendations:
- Start tracking the distance of the ride to see which type of city is traveling the farthest/shortest per ride.
- With the distance statistic we could see whether top charge more or less per mile in each type of city to balance average fares.
- Start tracking the amount of passengers per ride for each type of city which could lead to charging more per passenger.
